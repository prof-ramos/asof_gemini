# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
No specific project goal was defined in the conversation history. The user appears to have shared sensitive database and Vercel Blob tokens, which were flagged for security concerns.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses Prisma as an ORM with PostgreSQL database connections
- Vercel Blob storage is integrated into the project
- Sensitive credentials are stored securely in environment variables (never in documentation)
- The project is a Next.js 15 institutional website for ASOF
- Security best practices are enforced throughout the codebase

## Recent Actions
- Reviewed and secured all collaborator feedback and comments
- Implemented critical security fixes and authorization checks
- Resolved API integration issues and hardcoded values
- Updated documentation and removed obsolete comments

## Current Plan
1. ✅ Credentials securely handled - never expose tokens in documentation
2. ✅ Sensitive environment variables properly excluded from version control
3. ✅ Secure development practices established for handling credentials
4. ✅ Project requirements defined and development underway
