# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
No specific project goal was defined in the conversation history. The user appears to have shared sensitive database and Vercel Blob tokens, which were flagged for security concerns.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses Prisma as an ORM with PostgreSQL database connections
- Vercel Blob storage is integrated into the project
- Sensitive credentials (database URLs, API keys, Vercel tokens) are present in the environment
- The project is located at `/Users/gabrielramos/asof_gemini` on a macOS system
- Security best practices need to be followed to protect sensitive tokens

## Recent Actions
- Shared sensitive database URLs and Vercel Blob token in plain text
- These credentials were identified as security concerns requiring rotation
- No actual development work was performed in this session

## Current Plan
1. [TODO] Securely handle sensitive credentials by rotating exposed tokens
2. [TODO] Ensure sensitive environment variables are properly excluded from version control
3. [TODO] Establish secure development practices for handling credentials
4. [TODO] Define actual project goals and requirements for development work
